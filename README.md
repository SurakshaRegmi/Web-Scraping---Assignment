# Web-Scraping---Assignment
Web Scraping and Data Analysis
A full web-scraping and data analysis project with collecting data, organising and storing data, analysing data, and then visually communicating the insights.

## Background
In this Assignment, I have performed two web scrapings of the websites "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html" and 'https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html'. With this information, I have generated data tables with the information, printed statements about the data, and performed targeted analysis.

## Work Summary
The web scraping and data analysis on the Mars Data is performed on the two different jupyter notebook files:
part_1_mars_news.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook file which relates to the first website. It contains the code to scrape this news website of all of the titles and previews of news articles.
part_2_mars_news.ipynb is scraping weather data focused on mars. It also contains analysis of temperature and pressure and an investigation into the lengh of a martian year using only the data provided.

## Data Analysis
On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest. But it is always very cold there in human terms!

Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the  month  6 and highest in the month 9.

The data is exported to the csv file named as Mars_weather_data.csv
